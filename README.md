#this is a set of scripts for installing void linux with a secure setup in an semi-automated setup. 
#I am learning the installation process, this is a work in progress I am learning 
#I advise to not use these for reference or to install your own system as this is for me to work things out. 
#if you use these scripts, use at your own risk and I will not support any bugs or issues that result from them

#I have used quite a bit of code from: https://github.com/dylanbegin/void-install.git
#Their installation scripts are very thorough and well organized. I recommend going there for inspiration or reference over my scripts.
